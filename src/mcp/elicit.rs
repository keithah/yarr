//! Destructive-delete elicitation gate (MCP-only).
//!
//! Destructive deletes ([`crate::actions::action_is_destructive`]) get a real,
//! interactive confirmation prompt on the MCP surface via *elicitation* (rmcp
//! [`Peer::elicit_with_timeout`]): before a destructive action dispatches, the
//! server asks the connected client to confirm, and there is no way to
//! pre-authorize or skip that prompt from the call arguments — the client must
//! actually answer. A client without elicitation capability fails closed; this
//! remote protocol surface never treats missing confirmation as approval.
//!
//! This lives in the MCP protocol layer (not `tools.rs` / the app layer) because
//! elicitation needs the client [`Peer`], exactly like the scope checks in
//! `rmcp_server.rs`. `tools.rs` stays a thin dispatcher.
